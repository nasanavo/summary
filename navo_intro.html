<p>A major priority for NASA is making its astronomy holdings
available through standard interfaces to the science community.  These
pages describe the work of the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories
(NAVO), a collaboration of NASA's astronomy archives, who have
developed a comprehensive model for distributing data through
standardized machine-queryable interfaces.  Scientists looking to get
data may can go directly to our users guide page to learn how to use
these.  We also provide an introduction to the virtual observatory
interfaces used, the details of the mission implementation, and the
other activities of NAVO.</p>

<p> The NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO) program
    coordinates the efforts of NASA astronomy archives in providing 
    comprehensive and consistent access to NASA's astronomical data
    through standardized interfaces. NAVO comprises 

<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/vo/"
target="_blank">Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope (MAST)</a></li>
<li>the <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive/vo/"
target="_blank">High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research
Center (HEASARC)</a>,</li> <li>the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/voapi.html"
target="_blank">Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)</a>, and</li> <li>the
<a href="http://vo.ned.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">NASA
Extragalactic Database (NED)</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>These centers work in collaboration with the 
    other NASA archives and the US astronomy community to ensure that
    users can easily find and retrieve NASA data.  These pages
    describe the interfaces that have built, how users can get to
    these data, how they have been used, and other aspects of the NAVO
    collaboration.</p>

<p>
    NAVO also maintains the elements of the virtual observatory
    infrastructure that were built by the US community over the past
    decades.  This includes a registry of VO services worldwide that
    can be used by software and scientists to look for VO services and
    a framework for monitoring and validating operational VO services.
<p>
    The formal standards that have been developed as part of the
    International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) were
    specifically designed to provide standard machine APIs to
    astronomical data and have been adopted as the core of the NAVO
    efforts.  Since there are many such standards usually with many
    options, NAVO works to ensure that we adopt the standards with the
    highest benefit for doing science while maintaining consistency
    across the NAVO archives.
 <p>
    While we have attempted to minimize the use of VO jargon on these
    pages, a <a href="vo_glossary.html">glossary of the key
    standards</a> is included which provides a succinct description of
    what the standard is and the role it plays within NAVO.
</p>
<p>
    Our <a href="navo_users_guide.html">NAVO Users Guide</a> describes
    how to use NAVO from two perspectives.  Scientists who simply want
    access to data regardless of the archive it is located at may wish
    to use existing VO-capable tools query and retrieve data.  These
    include interfaces at NAVO archives (MAST's Portal Service or the
    HEASARC' Xamin) and community capabilities like TOPCAT and Aladin
    applications.  These pages can also help those who plan to build
    their own interfaces to the data publishing services of the NAVO
    archives.
</p>
<p>
    A complete and detailed specification of all implemented
    interfaces is given by mission/data set our <a
    href="navo_implemented_services.html">summary of implemented
    capabilities </a> In addition to providing a detailed breakdown of
    interfaces for more than 100 missions/datasets, this includes a
    summary and links to all the archive specific information we
    provide on NAVO interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href=navo_community.html> NAVO community page</a> describes
    efforts of the NAVO team to work with astronomical community
    generally, including representation on the International Virtual
    Observatory Alliance (IVOA), the US Virtual Observatory Alliance,
    other NASA archives and the any other interested parties.
</p>
<p>
    One area that NAVO is researching is how we can most effectively
    use such major datasets as the GSC 2, Galex, WISE and 2MASS
    catalogs all held at NAVO archives.  How do we effectively index
    these especially when we wish to correlate multiple large tables.
    The state of this effort is described in our <a
    href="navo_indexing.html"> indexing study.</a>
</p>
<p> 
    NAVO operations provides a monitoring service which looks at the
    reliability and compliance of both NAVO and worldwide VO services.
    We also track the usage of VO capabilities at all NAVO
    institutions.  The organization and results of these tracking
    activities are given in our <a href="navo_operations.html">
    operations</a> pages.
