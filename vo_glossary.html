        <h1 align="center">1. Virtual Observatory Glossary</h1>

        <p> This page briefly describes some of the VO terminology and
        technology that
            underlies the NAVO efforts and which may be referenced in
            the <a href="navo_intro.html">NAVO summary pages</a> and
            other NAVO publications.  This glossary is intended to
            provide a sense of what the terms mean.  NAVO has defined
            the specific VO standards that will be used in NAVO
            interfaces in our <a href="standards.html">Agreed VO
            Standards pages</a>. Our goal here is not to rigorously
            define these standards but to show how they are used in
            sufficient detail so that the reader can understand where
            and why they are used and the relationships among
            standards are clear.
        <p>
            The VO is the collaboration of astronomers and astronomy
            data providers using standard interfaces.  These
            interfaces allow the discovery and retrieval of
            information for users who wish to get data, and allow for
            the publication and dissemination of data by data
            providers.  These standards have been developed by the
            International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), a
            consortium of national virtual observatory
            institutions. More information is available at the <a
            href="http://www.ivoa.net/astronomers/"
            target="_blank">IVOA</a>.



        <p> We can break down the VO standards into three basic areas: 
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Registry</b><dd>
                Registry standards discuss how we populate and query
                the VO registry.  The VO registry is the mechanism by
                which users can discover VO services and capabilities.
            <dt><b>Data</b><dd>Data protocols (or data access
            protocols as they are referred to in
                IVOA documentation) are the protocols that allow users to query
                and retrieve information from data providers.  These tend to
                be the protocols one most directly associates with the VO.
            <dt><b>Content</b><dd>Content protocols generally define
            formats or elements of the
                files retrieved through the content services.  They
                may also help define the syntax of the parameters that
                are used in querying services.  Some content protocols
                define content that data providers should provide.

        </dl>
        <h2> Registry </h2>
        
<p>There are two kinds of registries - searchable registries, which
applications will query, and publishing registries, where resource
providers place their information. If you want to know of all the
registries that exist, the IVOA maintains a "<a
href="http://rofr.ivoa.net/" target="_blank">Registry of
Registries</a>".</p>

        <p>
<p>A registry is a list of all the services made available by
different data providers. Each entry records some information about
the type of service, who provided it, and what kind of data it
contains.</p>
        <p>
<p>There are two methods of publishing your service into a registry.
The most common method is to enter service information into a Fully
Searchable Registry.  The method, typically used by archive data
centers with many services, is to create a Publishing Registry.</p>
        <p>
<p>A publishing registry is the vehicle for making a resource
available to the virtual observatory (VO).  In particular, it can
create new descriptions of resources and share them with the rest of
the VO through the harvesting process. A data center, which may curate
a number of data collections and offer a variety of services to access
them, may operate their own publishing registry. A searchable registry
can also support the publishing function, which the VAO Registry at
STScI does. </p>
        <p>
        
        <p><b>Registry Searching</b> - Services put all sorts of
        useful information in their registry entries, and some tools
        make use of this. So for example, you can look specifically
        for image services, for X-ray data, for data curated by
        HEASARC, for services that are new this month, and so on. </p>
        
        <h2> Data </h2>

        <p>There are five major data protocols implemented at NAVO
        centers, Simple Cone Search, Table Access Protocol, Simple
        Image Access Protocol, Simple Spectral Access Protocol, and
        DataLink.</p>

        <p><b>Simple Cone Search</b> - This offers the simplest access
        to astronomical
            catalogs.  The input is sky position and radius.  A subset
            of the catalog within that radius is returned using the <a
            href="#votable">VOTable</a> format defined below.  This
            protocol is very easy to implement and query but scales
            poorly since a separate query is required for every
            position.
        </p>

        <p><b>Table Access Protocol (TAP)</b> - This service offers
        more flexible access to data tables, along the lines of those
        used to make queries to other databases.  The input is a query
        in Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL), which is basically
        a standardized version of SQL.  A data table is returned.</p>

        <p><b>Simple Image Access Protocol (SIAP)</b> This offers
        access to pixel data. The input is a position and a size. If
        it's a "cutout" service, the result will be an image, centered
        at the requested position, with the requested size. If it is
        an "atlas" service, which holds a collection of standard sized
        data frames, then the size is used to look for frames centered
        within that distance of the requested position, and the whole
        data frame(s) returned.
        </p>

        <p><b>Simple Spectral Access Protocol (SSAP)</b> - This
        service provides access to spectra. The input is a position
        and size. Like the "atlas" version of image access, the result
        will be any spectra whose target positions are within the
        stated distance of the requested position.</p>

        <p>

<p><b>DataLink</b> - This is an intermediate data access service that
connects discovered data-sets to the downloadable data files, services
that can act on the data files, and links to related resources.</p>

        <h2> Content </h2>

        There content standards used in the virtual observatory are
        VOTable, Data Models, ObsTAP, and UCDs.</p>

        <p>
<a name="votable"></a> <p><b>VOTable</b> - VOTable is designed as a
flexible storage and exchange format for tabular data, with particular
emphasis on astronomical tables. All VO tools interact with VOTable.
VOTable has more flexible descriptive metadata than CSV or FITS
tables.</p>
        <p>
<p><b>Data Models</b> - The IVOA is developing a suite of standard
data models.  This way data returned in a search service follows some
standard structure and uses standard ways of specifying what kind of
quantity is in a column, so that a lot more can be done
automatically.</p>
        <p>
<p><b>ObsTAP</b> - ObsTAP is a Table Access Protocol (TAP) interface
to observation data model. ObsTAP and the observation data model
describe observations in a broad sense (exactly what comprises an
"observation" is not well defined within astronomy and is left up to
the data provider to define for their data). ObsTAP also describes
archive data products (e.g., actual archive files). In general an
"observation" may be composed of multiple individual data
products.</p>
        <p>
<p><b>UCDs</b> - The Unified Content Descriptor (UCD) is a formal
vocabulary for astronomical data that is controlled by the
International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). The vocabulary is
restricted in order to avoid proliferation of terms and synonyms, and
controlled in order to avoid ambiguities as far as possible. It is
intended to be flexible, so that it is understandable to both humans
and computers. UCDs describe astronomical quantities, and they are
built by combining words from the controlled vocabulary. </p>
