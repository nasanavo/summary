This contains all the files used in the NASA Astronomy Virtual 
Observatories resources site.  The site is self-contained, you can 
download the contents as a zip file, then put the files into 
whatever directory you plan to use. 

The main page is index.html. This page assumes being able to use 
virtual includes.  The file "includes/footer.html"  needs to be 
edited to put in the "Responsible Official", the "Web Curator", 
and the email address for the "Contact Us" link.
