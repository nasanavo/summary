This contains all the files used in the NASA Astronomy Virtual 
Observatories resources site.  The site is self-contained, you can 
download the contents as a zip file (called summary-master.zip), 
then put the files into whatever directory you plan to use. 

The main page is index.html. This page assumes being able to use 
virtual includes.  The file "includes/footer.html"  needs to be 
edited to put in your "Responsible Official", "Web Curator", and 
email address for the "Contact Us" link.
