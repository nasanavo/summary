<h1 align="center">4. NAVO Study of Indexing of Large Tables</h1>

One of the most complex challenges facing the future of the NASA 
archive data centers is providing rapid access to very large catalogs 
of sources stored in databases. These catalogs nearly always 
include the spatial positions of sources and require intelligent 
and scalable queries to search and discover datasets. 
The selection of indexing method is a crucial part of the design 
of a database, yet there is not collection of benchmarks that 
record the performance of various indexing schemes that will 
allow database architects make informed choices of indexing schemes. 
Such is the purpose of this study, a collaboration between IPAC and STScI.
<p>
Based on the results of a <a href=NAVO_Indexes_Overview_v1.1.pdf>survey of indexing methods used in astronomy by Greene et al. (2015)</a>,
we have determined that the benchmarking will initially use the 
Postgres database, and we will derive benchmarks that show how query 
speed varies with  the HTM and HEALPix  indexing methods, 
and the index bin sizes (arcsecond, arcminute, etc.) 
and with size of search region, and how query times compare with 
database I/O times. The study will examine performance for 
catalogs with uniform sky coverage (2MASS) and locally dense coverage (WFPC2).
<p>
To date, we have developed and evaluated a C-based toolkit for adding indices 
to a Postgres table, running cone-search and caption timing information. 
First results to be added soon.
